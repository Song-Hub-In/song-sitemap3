# Welcome to Song-Hub-In!

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our organization's repositories. Your help is greatly appreciated! This README file provides instructions on how to contribute by running a Python and shell script that scrapes song audio files and related details from the Hungama.com website.

## How to Contribute

To get started, please follow the steps below:

1. **Fork the Repository:** Click the "Fork" button at the top right corner of the repository page to create a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.

2. **Access the Repository:** Open the repository page on GitHub by clicking on its name or navigating to it from your GitHub account.

3. **Open Codespaces:** On the repository page, click the "Code" button located at the top-right section of the page. From the dropdown menu, click on the "Codespaces" tab.

4. **Create a Codespace:** On the Codespaces tab, click on the "Create codespace on main" button. This will initiate the creation of a Codespace for the repository.

5. **Access the Codespace:** Wait for a few moments while the Codespace is being created. Once ready, you will be redirected to the Codespace environment within your browser.

6. **Open a Terminal:** Within the Codespace, you will see a terminal at the bottom of the screen. If the terminal is not visible, click on the menu button and select "Terminal" or "New Terminal."

7. **Run the Script:** In the terminal, paste the following code:
```console
chmod +x main.sh
./main.sh
```

This will make the main shell script executable and then execute it. Please wait until it finishes or you can close it at any time.

8. **Open a Pull Request:** Once the script has completed its execution, it's time to submit your changes. Go back to your forked repository on GitHub. You should see a banner indicating that you recently pushed a branch. Click on the "Compare & pull request" button next to the branch name.

9. **Submit the Pull Request:** Provide a descriptive title and any additional comments if needed. When you're ready, click the "Create pull request" button.

That's it! Your pull request has been submitted, and We will be notified. We appreciate your time and effort in helping us scrape song audio files and details from the Hungama.com website.
